# 🚗 BMW Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This project features an interactive **BMW Sales Dashboard** built using Microsoft **Power BI**. It is designed to provide comprehensive insights into vehicle sales performance, market trends, and customer preferences across different regions and models.

The primary goal is to leverage data visualization and analysis to support data-driven decision-making for a hypothetical automotive company or sales team.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides clear navigation and insights across several key performance areas:

### 1. Revenue & Sales Performance
*   **Total Revenue:** Tracked across different transmission types and price ranges.
*   **Average Price:** Overall average price is around $76K USD.
*   **Average Mileage:** Overall average mileage is around 100K KM.

### 2. Model & Specifications Analysis
*   **Total Sales Volume by Model:** Visualization of top models by volume, highlighting popular models like the **7 Series**, **X1**, and **3 Series**.
*   **Price vs. Mileage Scatter Plot:** Analysis of the relationship between average price (USD) and average mileage (KM), filterable by `Fuel Type` (Diesel, Electric, Hybrid, Petrol).

### 3. Filters & Navigation
*   **Interactive Filters:** Use slicers to filter data by specific `Model` or `Year`.
*   **Navigation:** Dedicated sections for 'Overview', 'Market & Performance', and 'Models' views.

## 🎯 Key Insights

*   **Pricing Trend:** The data shows average prices clustered in the $74K to $78K range.
*   **Model Popularity:** Specific models drive significant sales volume (up to 20M units for certain models in the simulated data).
*   **Transmission Performance:** Automatic transmissions account for the vast majority of total revenue and sales volume.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

*   **Microsoft Power BI:** The main platform for the dashboard, visualizations, and modeling.
*   **Power Query (M):** Used for data cleaning and transformation.
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated measures and custom metrics.
*   **Data Modeling:** Utilization of schema principles for efficient data structure.
